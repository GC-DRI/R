Congratulations on completing the Intro to R workshop! So far, youâ€™ve learned quite a bit about objects, functions, data structures, and other foundational concepts to further your R journey. For next steps, consider checking out one of the most suggested (and free!) book in beginner R, [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). You could also check out our other tutorials in R, such as [R for Data Analysis](https://github.com/GC-DRI/r_data_analysis_2021).

## Tutorials

## Further Readings
After they complete a workshop, participants often ask: what next? Here are some additional resources that can help you think about the projects that could be developed, the resources that you might need, the ways this skill could be used in the classroom, or debates in the field of digital humanities that provide context to what you have just learned.
[How to ask coding questions?](https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2021/12/15/how-to-ask-coding-questions/)
Leanne Fan, a digital fellow, wrote up a great post on how to get help with specific coding questions. While written with Python examples, this post has useful resources for searching for programming solutions broadly.
