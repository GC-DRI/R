Theory to practice
================

[\<\<\< Previous](06-packages.md) | [Return to Beginning \>\>\>](../README.md)

Congratulations on completing the Intro to R workshop! So far, youâ€™ve learned quite a bit about objects, functions, data structures, and other foundational concepts to further your R journey. For next steps, consider checking out one of the most suggested (and free!) book in beginner R, [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). You could also check out our other tutorials in R, such as [R for Data Analysis](https://github.com/GC-DRI/r_data_analysis_2021).

## Tutorials
Our workshops provide a foundational comprehension of digital skills and tools often used in digital humanities and humanistic social science research. While having a strong foundation is important, there is usually more to learn if you want to get started on your own. Now that you have an awareness of the basics, here are some other tutorials to try that will extend your learning.

[The Summer Institutes for Computational Social Science (SICSS)](https://sicss.io/overview)   
If you're interested in exploring R further, SICSS online lectures and resources on computational social science research is a really great addition to help you build on some of the fundemental concepts we've explored. 

[Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/)   
This book covers some of the common ways in which you can explore text through principles of tidy data. If you're interested in qualitative analysis of large text corpus, this might be a good next step for you!

## Further Readings
After they complete a workshop, participants often ask: what next? Here are some additional resources that can help you think about the projects that could be developed, the resources that you might need, the ways this skill could be used in the classroom, or debates in the field of digital humanities that provide context to what you have just learned.

[How to ask coding questions?](https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2021/12/15/how-to-ask-coding-questions/)   
Leanne Fan, a digital fellow, wrote up a great post on how to get help with specific coding questions. While written with Python examples, this post has useful resources for searching for programming solutions broadly.


## Projects
[Quick and easy mapping with R](https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2021/11/03/quick-and-easy-mapping-with-r/)   
In this post, Rilquer Mascarenhas, a digital fellow, describes how to use the R package `sf` to make some simple quick maps.    
   
[A computational social science perspective on qualitative data exploration: Using topic models for the descriptive analysis of social media data](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15228835.2019.1616350)   
Interested in exploring the reasons folx leave or stay in abusive relationships, Maria Y. Rodriguez and Heather Storer utilized topic modeling approaches to explore a large corpus of Twitter data and found it to provide good guidance for deeper analysis. Rodriguez's script is available through [her github repository](https://github.com/MariaYR/WhyIStayed).
   
[R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/index.html)   
The R graph gallery provides useful tools and R script for those who might be interested in plotting their results. Showcasing a range of data visualization, this is a good starting point if you're up for the challenge in visualizing your data for publications.
